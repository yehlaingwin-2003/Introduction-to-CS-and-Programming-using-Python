## 📚 About the Course
This course provides an introduction to computer science and programming using Python.  
It emphasizes:
- Fundamental programming concepts (variables, conditionals, loops, functions)  
- Problem-solving with algorithms and decomposition  
- Recursion and simple data structures  
- Basics of computational complexity  

It is designed for students with little or no programming experience.

## 📂 Repo Structure
- `lecture1-n/` → Each lecture folder which contains lecture notes and small code snippets from each lecture  
- `psets/` → Problem sets (in progress)  
- `exercises/` → Short practice problems  

---

## 🎯 Purpose
I am taking this course to:
- Strengthen my understanding of **Python** 
- Build **systematic problem-solving habits**  
- Prepare for more advanced computer science topics like algorithms, data structures, and systems

## 📌 Notes
- I’m **still going through the lectures and problem sets**, so this repo will keep evolving.  
- The code here represents my personal learning — it may not always be perfect or the most optimized.  
- If you are also studying this course, I recommend working through the problems yourself first before looking at other solutions 🙂
